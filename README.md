# gfinvim
An open-source implementation of Graham Finlayson's invariant image algorithm. Please be aware that this algorithm is patented.

I can not guarantee that this is the 100% consistent implementation of the original paper. However, it should be almost correct and the results look plausible.

MATLAB/Octave Code: see /src/m/demo.m for demonstration. You may need to compile the MEX code for Fast Gaussian Transform.

C++ Code: will be available when I feel like doing it.
